# ClinkedIn

### Description 

You are an intrepid entrepreneur in the niche social network space.  Your latest trillion dollar idea is ClinkedIn, a social network for prisons.  This social network will allow inmates to create inmate accounts with their personal details, including why they're in prison, as well as to socialize and find friends with similar criminal interests.  You'll also be wanting a way to monetize this app, so having a section that allows for the listing of services is your entryway to the real money.  

You'll be building this in teams, and we're only concerned with building the API right now.  Use static collections as a "database" for now.  Your first task as a team will be to break down the following requirements into smaller chunks.  You are welcome to work on some tasks together, but everyone will need to have commits with substance.

### Requirements

- [x] As an incarcerated person, I want to join a social network so that I'm not lonely.
- [x] As ClinkedIn member, I want to find other Clinkers by Interest.
- [x] As a ClinkedIn member, I want to list my services so that other inmates can aske me for help.
- [x] As a ClinkedIn member, I want to keep track of my friends so that I can know who has my back.
- [x] As a ClinkedIn member, I want to keep track of my enemies so that I know who to watch out for.

### Stretch Goals
- [x] As ClinkedIn member, I want to know who my friend's friends are so that I can build up my crew.
- [x] As a Clinker, I want to update and remove pieces of information, like interests and services so that as I evolve as a person I can let everyone know.
- [x] As a Warden, I want to get all inmates information so that I can peruse the population.
- [x] As a Clinker, I want to know how many days remain in my sentence so that I can keep track.
- [x] As a ClinkedIn member, I can patronize the services of another member if I can afford them.
